## Motivation
As a twenty-something year old living in Turkey in the current economic environment, I think it is safe to say that I have no idea how much I spend -or to be precise- I do not know how much of these purchases are justifiable. As the prices fluctuate, I can no longer confidently say that something deserves the price that says on the price tag. At the end of the day, I cannot help but to feel like I have overspent. 

My aim in making this project was to gain a deeper understanding of my spending habits better through an anaylisis of my data and to see if I have any behavioral patters that lead to overspending or tend to splurge in certain categories.

Prepare a public Github repository for your project.
• DO NOT change the name of the project, because we will grade
what we will find in it at the end of the semester.
• Create a README.md file and describe your dataset, project
idea and plan. This will be the material we look for this
assignment.
• You can turn your repo private between 05/12/24 to 10/01/25,
but DO NOT forget to make it again public.
• In the meantime, make sure to update repo regularly, so that
we can monitor your activity.
• Submit the URL of the repo to SuCourse Assignment
