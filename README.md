Prepare a public Github repository for your project.
• DO NOT change the name of the project, because we will grade
what we will find in it at the end of the semester.
• Create a README.md file and describe your dataset, project
idea and plan. This will be the material we look for this
assignment.
• You can turn your repo private between 05/12/24 to 10/01/25,
but DO NOT forget to make it again public.
• In the meantime, make sure to update repo regularly, so that
we can monitor your activity.
• Submit the URL of the repo to SuCourse Assignment
